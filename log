	(1) fix some bugs in the exec_multicmd(); the return value of wait(NULL) must be one of the fork process.
	    just a for loop would result bugs.
	(2) background process:
	    'cmdname' &
	    & means the parent will not wait for this process to return. So we can execute a new command while the background process still running
	(3) already done:
 		(a) readline, history, tab completion
		(b) execute an command, including some several command
		(c) pipe, input and  outpue redirection
		(d) set up the basic framework of shortcut, and have handled the Ctrl-C shortcut
		(e) background process.

	(3) already done:
 		(a) readline, history, tab completion
		(b) execute an command, including some several command
		(c) pipe, input and  outpue redirection
